# Foreman Backend (Serverless)

This repository contains only serverless API functions for Vercel.
There is no frontend build step.

The Foreman backend exposes:

- /api/webhook  (GitHub App webhook endpoint)
- utils/github.js
- utils/foreman.js

The project intentionally uses the Node.js Serverless runtime.
